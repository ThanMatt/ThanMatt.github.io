It's been a while since my last blog post.

I have some stuff to share about React, particularly **hooks**.

I've heard of Hooks for a long time, probably two months ago. *(I just started studying react four months ago)*. I just finished studying redux and decided to study hooks after writing this blog post.

After reading the introduction from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hooks doc</a>, I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX_L39UvZes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> that helped me get started with hooks. I've seen a few examples of using react hooks and decided to try it on my own.

I made a simple react app that fetches **100** posts using the <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON Placeholder API</a>

Screenshots below are my source codes using a class component -- use of *render* method and *this*.

And a functional component -- use of hooks.

<center><i>Functional Component</i></center>

What can I say?

Using hooks look cleaner and readable than that ol' pesky *this* render method class components stuff. I'm beginning to fall in love with Hooks üòç

I mean, the screenshots above are still readable because the app is too simple. But when it comes to flexibility, using hooks may seem like a better choice when developing large-scale projects.

So, should I ditch class components and embrace functional components? Probably soon

I've got a lot of things to learn!

*Should I study apollo to ditch redux as well?* ü§î
