I just finished studying redux and decided to study hooks after writing this blog post.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">After reading the introduction from the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hooks doc</a>, I watched this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX_L39UvZes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> that helped me get started with hooks. I‚Äôve seen a few examples of using react hooks and decided to try it on my own.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">I made a simple react app that fetches <strong>100</strong> posts using the <a href=\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JSON Placeholder API</a></p>\n<p class=\"content\">Screenshots below are my source codes using a class component ‚Äî use of <em>render</em> method and <em>this</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">And a functional component ‚Äî use of hooks.</p>\n<center><i>Class Component</i></center>\n<p class=\"content\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&#x26;id=1OiWaA-GPOJYh7egsHADxmzDQN20Ek9Ip\" alt=\"class component\"></p>\n<center><i>Functional Component</i></center>\n<p class=\"content\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&#x26;id=161or2h4rke5q-4YzsJ-u2JPVxY7XjPyn\" alt=\"functional component\"></p>\n<p class=\"content\">What can I say?</p>\n<p class=\"content\">Using hooks look cleaner and readable than that ol‚Äô pesky <em>this</em> render method class components stuff. I‚Äôm beginning to fall in love with Hooks üòç</p>\n<p class=\"content\">I mean, the screenshots above are still readable because the app is too simple. But when it comes to flexibility, using hooks may seem like a better choice when developing large-scale projects.</p>\n<p class=\"content\">So, should I ditch using class components? Probably soon</p>\n<p class=\"content\">I‚Äôve got a lot of things to learn from react!</p>\n<p class=\"content\"><em>Should I study apollo to ditch redux as well?</em> ü§î</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"React Hooks","date":"September 08, 2019","tags":["dev","javascript","react.js"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/react-hooks","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/mauch-bot"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mauch Bot","tags":["dev","javascript","nodejs"]}},"next":null}}}
